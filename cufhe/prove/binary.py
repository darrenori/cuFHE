# To use these functions, you can run python and then import like -

# These methods carry out binary addition via 'digital logic'
# This is really what happens at the logic circuit level.
# So, this is a pretty abstract use of programming to illustrate
# what happens on silicon using code many, many, levels above that!

# to add binary numbers of arbitrary size.
